## Known issues
- Clicking the favorite button on the main contact page does not remove the list of contacts. But, it will show under the favorite page.
- The favorite button in the favorite page has not been implemented.
- The main contact page does not always show the latest update after adding a new contact. This aslo affects the unique name validation and delete page.
- If you add a new contact, the delete page doesn't dispaly the newly created contact. As a result, you cannot delete this contact.
