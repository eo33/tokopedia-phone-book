This repository contain the source file for a phone application project for Tokopedia technical interview.

## IMPORTANT!
Please check my second attempt at this problem here:
- Deployed site: https://eo33tokopedia2.netlify.app/
- Repository: https://github.com/eo33/second-attempt-tokped

The second attempt was made after the 1-week deadline. 

## Work progress
- 04/09/2023 - Read through the problem, setup development environment and finished Figma design [(Link)](https://www.figma.com/file/vh2f3Rm6dr5TzVuK8gRjzv/Untitled?type=design&node-id=0%3A1&mode=design&t=yfhlskYjPseufGcl-1).
- 05/09/2023 - Installed apollo server and GraphQL. Read through the GraphQL docs
- 06/09/2023 - Redesign UI, completed ContactList component, and worked on AddContact component.
- 07/09/2023 - Finished AddContact and adding multiple number feature.
- 08/09/2023 - Partially implement if favorite feature, modified search bar and worked on delete contact. Worked on delete component. Also documented known issues.

## Known issues
- Clicking the favorite button on the main contact page does not remove the list of contacts. But, it will show under the favorite page.
- The favorite button in the favorite page has not been implemented.
- The delete page doesnt reflect the latest update from the server.
- If you add a new contact, the delete page doesn't dispaly the newly created contact. As a result, you cannot delete this contact.

_Note: The second attempt addresses these issues_
